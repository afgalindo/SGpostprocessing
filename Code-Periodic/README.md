	1. NEED TO CREATE A FUNCTION THAT RECONSTRUCTS THE SOLUTION.
		*Multiply by S , and creates the basis of the chaos expansion.
	2. CREATE METHOD TO COMPUTE EXPECTATION.
	3. PROBABLY THE EVOLUTION IN TIME WILL HAVE TO BE MOVED TO SG SOMEHOW
	   SINCE YOU WILL HAVE TO CAPTURE THE COEFFICIENTS AT EACH TIME STEP.
